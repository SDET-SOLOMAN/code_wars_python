# Issue
#
# Looks like some hoodlum plumber and his brother has been running around and damaging your stages again.
#
# The pipes connecting your level's stages together need to be fixed before you receive any more complaints.
#
# The pipes are correct when each pipe after the first is 1 more than the previous one.
#
# Task
#
# Given a list of unique numbers sorted in ascending order, return a new list so that the values increment
# by 1 for each index from the minimum value up to the maximum value (both included).
#
# Example
#
# Input:  1,3,5,6,7,8 Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
