# You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change
# from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.
#
# Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns
# a string representing the state the light should change to.
#
# For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

    if current == 'green':
        return 'yellow'

        return 'red'

# using match / python Switch
